final Map<String, String> labelDescriptions = {
  'Tomato_Bacterial_spot': '''
Tomato bacterial spot is caused by Xanthomonas bacteria.  
It appears as small, water-soaked spots on leaves, stems, and fruit.  
As the disease progresses, the spots become dark and may have a yellow halo.  
Infected leaves may become distorted and drop prematurely.  
This disease spreads quickly in warm, wet conditions.  
Proper sanitation, crop rotation, and copper-based sprays help manage it.
''',

  'Tomato_Early_blight': '''
Early blight is a fungal disease caused by Alternaria solani.  
It starts with dark, concentric rings (target-like spots) on lower, older leaves.  
Leaves may yellow and drop, weakening the plant.  
It spreads quickly in humid and warm environments.  
It also affects stems and fruit, causing sunken, dry lesions.  
Crop rotation and fungicide sprays are common management strategies.
''',

  'Tomato_Late_blight': '''
Late blight is a devastating disease caused by Phytophthora infestans.  
It causes large, brown, water-soaked lesions on leaves and stems.  
White mold may appear on the undersides of leaves in humid weather.  
Fruits develop firm, brown, greasy-looking spots.  
The disease spreads rapidly, especially in cool, wet conditions.  
Management includes fungicides and immediate removal of infected plants.
''',

  'Tomato_Leaf_Mold': '''
Leaf mold is caused by the fungus Passalora fulva.  
Yellow spots form on upper leaf surfaces, turning into mold underneath.  
It thrives in humid, poorly ventilated environments.  
Severely infected leaves curl, die, and drop prematurely.  
It rarely affects fruit but weakens the plant significantly.  
Improving airflow, using resistant varieties, and applying fungicides help control it.
''',

  'Tomato_Septoria_leaf_spot': '''
This disease is caused by the fungus Septoria lycopersici.  
It shows up as small, round, grayish spots with dark borders on lower leaves.  
It usually appears after fruit set and spreads upward on the plant.  
Affected leaves turn yellow and fall off, reducing photosynthesis.  
Wet weather and overhead irrigation increase disease spread.  
Sanitation and timely fungicide application help prevent outbreaks.
''',

  'Tomato_Spider_mites_Two_spotted_spider_mite': '''
Two-spotted spider mites are tiny pests that suck plant sap.  
They cause yellow or bronze stippling on leaves.  
Fine webbing is often visible on the undersides of leaves.  
Heavy infestations lead to leaf curling, drying, and drop.  
They thrive in hot, dry conditions and reproduce rapidly.  
Miticides or insecticidal soaps can help reduce populations.
''',

  'Tomato__Target_Spot': '''
Target spot is a fungal disease caused by Corynespora cassiicola.  
It creates round, brown lesions with concentric rings on leaves.  
Spots enlarge over time and may merge, causing leaf drop.  
It also affects stems and sometimes fruits with dark lesions.  
The disease spreads with wind-blown spores in moist conditions.  
Preventive fungicide use and crop residue cleanup help manage it.
''',

  'Tomato__Tomato_YellowLeaf__Curl_Virus': '''
This virus is transmitted by whiteflies and severely affects tomato crops.  
It causes upward curling and yellowing of young leaves.  
Plants may become stunted and fail to set fruit properly.  
Infected plants produce poor yields and reduced quality.  
Once infected, plants cannot be cured of the virus.  
Controlling whiteflies and using resistant varieties is key to prevention.
''',

  'Tomato__Tomato_mosaic_virus': '''
Tomato mosaic virus causes mottled, light and dark green leaf patterns.  
Leaves may become narrow, distorted, and curled.  
Fruit may have internal browning and uneven ripening.  
The virus spreads via contaminated tools, hands, and seeds.  
It can survive for long periods on surfaces and in soil.  
Hygiene, resistant seeds, and crop rotation help in control.
''',

  'Tomato_healthy': '''
This tomato plant is healthy with no signs of disease or stress.  
Leaves are green and intact with no spots, curling, or yellowing.  
The plant is growing well and producing flowers and fruits.  
There are no signs of insect damage or fungal infection.  
A healthy plant benefits from proper watering, sunlight, and nutrients.  
Maintain good care to ensure continued health and productivity.
